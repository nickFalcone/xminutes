# IhaveXminutes

I wanted to see what I could get done during the "time in-between."  

## You have to leave for an appointment in 7 minutes.

That's an awkward amount of time - not long enough for a major effort - not short enough to justify doing nothing.

## People are bored

According to Google Trends, [people are bored](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=i%27m%20bored).

[IhaveXminutes.com](http://ihavexminutes.com) is trying to reduce boredom.
